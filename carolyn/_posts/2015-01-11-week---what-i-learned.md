Throughout this first week of Object-Oriented Programing I learned a lot of valuable information.

#The Schedule
The first assignment of the class was to redesign the Upper School schedule. This task was intentionally left open ended without a lot of instruction. As we analyzed our first attempts to change the schedule, by looking at the assumptions we made, it quickly became clear that many perspectives were missing and there were many options all of the groups did not consider. In the second attempt, with the gained knowledge of the importance of consulting many people, more than just students, who would be effected by the Upper School schedule change, all of the groups created schedules that included what other people thought would form a better schedule. The creation of the altered schedules was a difficult task, but the presentation of the ideas to guests seemed to be where our class struggled the most. In future presentations, we will need to make sure the guests are welcomed and have a clear understanding of the organization of the presentation. The design process and presentation for any product was demonstrated in this task and the information learned is going to be essential to use when we work on projects this semester.

#GitHub, Terminal, Sublime, and the Blog
On Friday, Ben and Schmitty did a great job of explaining how to edit the blog. GitHub, Terminal, and Sublime connect and function together to allow us to edit the blog. This blog is and will continue to be an important portion of the class, so these details are invaluable.
Details on this process are found on Ben's post, [How to Post](http://blakecs-spring2015.github.io/how-to-post/).
