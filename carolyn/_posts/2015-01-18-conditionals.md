# Conditionals Tutorial


There are a couple of different types of conditionals: if, elif, and else. Once a statement is true, the next line of code will be run. An elif and else statement is only run once the first if statement is false. It is important to use “and” and “or” properly. When using “and” both of the statements must be true for the whole statement to be true. But for “or” statements only one of the statements must be true for the statement to be true. This can eliminate redundancy in your code. 




syntax:
--if--
 AN IF STATMENT begins the conditional. the syntax for beginning an if statement is as follows
 if condition==true/false:
--elif--
 elif is a combination of the two words else if. so essentiallly it allows you to add additional conditions to your program which are dependednt on the first one having a certain outcome so if we have this program:
 if conditon==true:
 	print "yes"
 elif condition=/=false or condition =/=true:
 	print "what?"
 else:
 	print "no"
 the program will run the if, or else statements if it is either true or false, but if it is neither, which is convered by our elif statement (also it is not physically possible but just bear with me) it will skip the if function and go straight to the elif function to print "what?".
--else--
 else is essentially the end to your conditional. if none of the conditions match or are true, the program runs the else function.
