# Conditionals Tutorial


There are a couple of different types of conditionals: if, elif, and else. Once a statement is true, the next line of code will be run. An elif and else statement is only run once the first if statement is false. It is important to use “and” and “or” properly. When using “and” both of the statements must be true for the whole statement to be true. But for “or” statements only one of the statements must be true for the statement to be true. This can eliminate redundancy in your code.
