This week was very productive. We made a lot of advancements in our efficiencies and I think we are now well prepared for anything we may encounter throughout the semester.

One of the most profound items we worked on was the class community expectations. This conversation allowed each of the members of the class to give ideas as to how we can make the most of our time together and outline how to appropriately interact. The phrases “assume best intentions,” “be excellent to each other,” “bias towards action,” and “nil-sine-labore” (nothing without labor) are our new main guiding principles. These phrases indicate that we must all work together in a positive manner and the most effective way to determine whether an idea will work is to test it out.
