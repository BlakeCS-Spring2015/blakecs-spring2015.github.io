# First Week

This week of Computer Science went by extremely quickly. Right away, I learned an important lesson about managing documents that we all need. Everyone always needs all the information that we have on a subject. 

The task of redesigning the schedule made me rethink how you design something to begin with. I really like how my second group approached the task by first researching and talking to a large and diverse group of people. We attempted to really try and find what problems other people see and what they currently like. It was too easy the first time to think about the design from a student’s perspective. Presentations were defiantly casual. My group barely finished our rough draft of our schedule right before. We needed to put more time and thought into the best way to present our information. It was probably extremely overwhelming to present two schedules as well. 

Overall, I questioned assumptions and altered my mindset to start working with design. At home I started reading the book “The Innovators” by Walter Isaacson. One of his first messages is that the technology “revolution” was not just a couple of geniuses, but so many people collaborating. I think I experienced that this week and hope to remind myself of that throughout the semester.
