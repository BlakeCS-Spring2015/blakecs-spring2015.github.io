Just in case you didn't know, we are using Markdown in class, a really cool compressed version of html that makes formatting things like this blog post **a lot** easier!

You can do so much, but knowing how to do it can be hard. I'm going to make a quick blog post for people who want to get crackin on updating their blog. I can't spoil all of the mystery for you yet, so I'm just going to include some md shortcuts. 

<br>

### Headings!

+ A Heading on your blog post gives it an air of importance and pomp. 

..* Some different heading sizes:

# Heading 

## Heading

### Heading

#### Heading 

##### Heading  

+ To make something a heading, you just put a "#" sign before it or underline it with "=" or "-" 

<!-- arbitrary comment --> 

    # Heading 

    ##### Heading 

or 

	Heading  
	====

	Heading  
	----

<br> 

### Emphasis!

You can *Italicise* and **bold** things like this!

    *Italics*  or _Italics_

    **bold** or  __both__

<br> 

### Links!

+ If you want to link to something, the quickest way is to write the text [in brackets] followed by (the link in pharanthesis)

+ [For example][glitchy]

[glitchy]: (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

    [alt text](link "link name")

or 

    [alt text][i]
    [i]: (link "link name")

<br>

### Pictures! 

+ You can also add pictures, kind of like this.

![Picturrrrrrrre!!!](http://i302.photobucket.com/albums/nn112/Claudnsophia/dancing-man.gif)


    ![alt text](link "link name")

or 

    ![alt text][i]
    [i]: (link "link name")

<br> 

### Blockquotes!

> I honestly just think that this looks really cool, and makes everything I write seem fancy.

    > Blockquote

<br>

### Youtube Videos

+ Once again, not really sure when we would need this. The video is cool, so why not?

<!-- arbitrary comment -->
