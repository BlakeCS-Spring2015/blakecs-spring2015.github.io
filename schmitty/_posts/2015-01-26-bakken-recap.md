## Recap

Today, we visited the Bakken Museum, along with (at the end) around a 120 kids on a field trip. They were cute, however are completely irrelevant.

In order, we

+ Took measurments of the "Cabenit of Curiosities"
+ Took a look at it in person
+ Q & A for clarifying questions pertaining to the App
+ Explored the Museum to get a feel for the atmosphere

Notes were taken in whatever way worked best for the notetaker, and we clarified a lot of our initial process: the overall goals and empathising with the eventual user.
All in all, it was a very sucessful visit.
