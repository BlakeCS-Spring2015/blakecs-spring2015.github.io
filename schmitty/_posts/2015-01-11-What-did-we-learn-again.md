So, what did we learn again? For me, we learned not nessasarily about coding, or programming, or building software. We
learned about how to take the first steps. We talked a lot in class about assumptions, and I think that we all came into
the class with assumptions about what we would be doing. I though that we would jump right into python, which is why
I was a little bit confused when we started off with the schedule. Now it makes much more sense though. I had to look
past the programming itself, to the larger elements involved.

I was used to writing code that only I would ever use,
I had never though about the other persepectives that we might need to take into account. I know that the way I write
code, and do any other project will change. It was a lot of fun actually, designing the schedule, but I think that we
all learned a lot more than how else our school **could** operate. Though **could** have started with `for` loops, or `functions`, but I don't think that we `should` have started any other way.
