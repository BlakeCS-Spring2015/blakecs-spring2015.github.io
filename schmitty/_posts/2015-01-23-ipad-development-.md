## Ipad Apps and Other Fun Things

Hello all! I've done a bit of research into Ipad App's, so I'm posting some of my findings.

Languages!

+ Apple apps work through Xcode, an interface specific to creating Mac apps. It works with the language Objective - C, a branch of the C family of programming languages.
+ The Mac Developer Library links to [this](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapOSX/books/RM_YourFirstApp_Mac/Articles/Introduction.html),
as an introductory tutorial. It's long, but seems to include most of the necessary parts.
+ Xcode can be downloaded straight from the app store, and the developer website is [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/)


Testing Code

+ The consensus on testing code is that an actual Ipad is needed. As a class, I'm sure that we'll be able to find one.


Tutorials

+ There are a lot of tutorials online for app development, and for reference sake, I'm including a couple.
