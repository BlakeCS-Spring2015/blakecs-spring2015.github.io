This week we did not really talk bout programming or coding or what i thought we would talk about in our first week. Instead, we talked more about the first steps in a creative process as well as how to work well as a team. I figured out how to evenly distribute work and assign jobs to specific people in a way where the end product is not a giant mess. We also learned about how to more effectively present material so that the focus is more clear and it is also easier to change details.
