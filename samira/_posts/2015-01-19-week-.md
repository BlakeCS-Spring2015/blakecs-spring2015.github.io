This week, we set some goals that we wanted to achieve before being presented with our project for the rest of the semester. Upon meeting on Monday, it became clear that we needed a good way to communicate in order to solve issues and ask questions, as a lot of people had trouble making their first blog post. I talked to Schmitty, and they helped me figure out that my "_posts" folder had been deleted when I deleted my test posts. Our goals for this week included becoming more familiar with the blog, choosing a method of communication to ask questions and troubleshoot, and to create a way to brush up on our programming skills.

One issue we repeatedly struggled with this week was using our time effectively to simply figure out *what we wanted to do.* With the number of people in the class, it's difficult to efficiently make decisions that satisfy everyone, and can slow us down a lot. We don't have trouble maintaining a professional attitude and respecting all opinions, but we need to get better at collectively reaching conclusions or we won't get anywhere. That being said, we have the whole semester to grow in that direction, and I'm sure we'll see improvement with more practice.
