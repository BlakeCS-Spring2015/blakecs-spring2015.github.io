This week, in preparation for facing what’s to come, we redesigned the upper school schedule to understand the overarching lesson of how to work for others. As software designers, we should have our users’ best interests in mind when creating. I learned that presentation of an idea is just as important as the idea itself. While we may have been most concerned with the content of our creations, we also need to pay attention to how we can offer them in a professional manner. This is a skill that will not only help us in this class, but also in the real world.

We also learned about how to make blog posts, which we will continue to do for the rest of the semester. We use GitHub, which makes it easy for all of us to collaborate on big projects, such as the blog. We were taught by Ben and Schmitty – we will be both teaching and learning from our peers this semester, which is sure to lead to some astounding results in regard to our learning and skill sets.
