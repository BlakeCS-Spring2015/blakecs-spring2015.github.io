This week, we got our organization finalized. We decided to have two class leaders each day, decided randomly. Using Slack as our main method of communication, leaders will plan for class the next day. This method has so far been relatively successful, as it helps us follow our rule to have bias towards action, even if that action is not in exactly the right direction.

One of our biggest triumph this week was the creation of our class constitution. In it, we outline the expectations we have of ourselves and our classmates. This was a huge step forward in regard to our class becoming the most successful it can be. We've made our rules clear, and are that much closer to being a fully functioning, semi-professional software team.

We also began to think about our cental project this semester. We came up with some initial ideas about what it should have, and questions we need to ask about it. We concluded that it is important to understand the design process and what it is we're trying to make before getting too far the design of the product itself.
