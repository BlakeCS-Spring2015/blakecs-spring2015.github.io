<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>
  Software Design is a course about designing software. The emphasis here is on the word <strong>design</strong>, which we might define as the process of developing creative solutions to real human problems. Throughout the semester, we will develop our design skills as they relate to solving real human problems with software.
</p>
<p>
  Typically, when we start to design a solution to a problem, we do not have a complete understanding of what the final product will look like. That is also true in this class in the sense that the final outcome of this class is not currently set (since figuring that out will itself be a part of the design process). Rather, you will be co-creating the content of the course with me by setting goals for yourself and your teammaters, defining timelines, and evaluating your successes and failures so that you can refine and redefine your goals for the next iteration of their design. Which is to say, this is a student-led class.
</p>
<p>
  The major focus of the course will be a semester-long software project that we will work on in conjunction with a community organization in the Twin Cities. Much much more on this project will be discussed in the coming days.
</p>
<p>
  In terms of the nitty-gritty computer-science-y stuff, you should expect to solidify and build upon the algorithmic thinking and programming skills we developed in the intro level course. To be sure, we will branch out into more complex programming topics (likely including things like functional and procedural programming, objects and object-orientation, and application architecture) as they become relevant to our large project.
</p>

<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To learn the process of solving real-world problems through software solutions</li>
  <li>To develop basic fluency in the processes of design and engineering</li>
  <li>To learn how to understand and creatively solve human problems</li>
  <li>To understand that writing software is a creative and collaborative process</li>
  <li>We'll probably (read: definitely) also learn a bunch of stuff about programming and computers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Expectations For Each Other</h2>
<p>
  <em>To be developed...</em>
</p>

<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>
  I am only assigning you one assignment: update your blog at least 1x a week. All other assignments will be determined by you and your classmates.
</p>
<p><em>To be developed...</em></p>

<h2>Assessment &amp; Grading</h2>
<p>
  This course will emphasize <strong>feedback</strong> as our primary mechanism for assessment and grading. Feedback will be multidirectional. I will be giving each of you regular feedback. You will also be giving each other regular feedback. You will also be giving me regular feedback. The idea here is that we all learn better and deeper by giving each other honest, thoughtful criticism ( both positive and constructive) than we do through letters and percentages. Like all other aspects of this course, the way this translates into a grading policy will be co-constructed with you.
</p>
<p>
  I also want to take a second to point out that this course is an upper level elective. Therefore, I am assuming that you are here because you want to be here, you want to learn, and you are motiviated to put work into this class. Which is to say that I'm assuming each of you are motiviated by more than just a letter grade.
