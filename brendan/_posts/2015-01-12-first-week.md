**This is bold** while this is not

There is a break after this line

<br>

Heading below

### This is a heading

+ This is a list 

..* I don't know what this is 

# The number of pound signs 

## Controls how large the heading is

### With more

#### Meaning smaller 

<br> 

> Note to self: Ask Shmitty how underlines work and what breaks are needed for.

<!-- This is a comment --> 

    I dont know how this bit works 

    I should ask Schmitty

<!-- what -->
    What is this nonsense

<br> 


*This is italisized*  

**This is bold**

__This should be both but isn't__



    *Italics*  or _Italics_

    **bold** or  __both__

<br> 



+ If you want to link to something, the quickest way is to write the text [in brackets] followed by (the link in pharanthesis)

+ [This is a link][glitchy]

Is there a way to make the video play in the browser?

This is just a picture with a link


<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/compsci/images/compscibanner.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="100" height="100" border="10" /></a>

I made the video link bigger


In my first week of cs, I learned these things. It was cool.
