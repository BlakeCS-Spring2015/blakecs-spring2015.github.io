This week, I learned how to create a new folder after I accidentally deleted mine. After messing around with this for a few days, I figured out that creating a new folder with the same name as the one I deleted works as a replacement. I was trying to figure out how to undo my steps, but sadly, I couldn't get far enough back. Luckily, I eventually figured out how to fix my mistake and now can create this post. I had never used anything like Github before, so I have had difficulty so far in the class, but I will get used to it and learn to use this as well as whatever else we use in the future. I can't wait to get further in the class and to get going on our project.
