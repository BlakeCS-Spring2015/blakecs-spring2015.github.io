#Jan 23 Recap

Group Leaders: Samira and Ben

In standup, we asked what went well with our constitution discussion, and what everyone thought we needed to get done between Friday and Monday. There was a general consensus that the discussion on the previous day had gone well, in that we were productive and generated good ideas. Most people agreed that we needed to decide on what information is important for us to find out about our app at the museum on Monday.

Afterwards, we split up into four groups to brainstorm general thoughts on what the app should do, how it should look, and what to ask at the museum. In the process, the groups put their ideas on the whiteboards, the pictures of which are here. With 25 minutes left in the class, we reconvened to go over the ideas that each group had formed.

With all of the work the groups had done, we ended up with this list of questions and ideas to think about when designing. We had some great designs, but (with the exception of one timeline idea), they all were some variation on “here’s a list/grid/shelf with all the objects, tap to see more info.” As we discussed our ideas, we realized that we needed to take a step back and think more about what the goals for our project were and what we want to accomplish.

#Jan 27 Recap

Group Leaders: Olivia and Brendan

In standup, we discussed our thoughts on the Bakken visit and the next steps we should take. Everyone seemed  really pleased with our visit and we made a good relationship there. Exploring the cabinets and the other exhibits was really helpful. Moving forward we thought that we needed to start to understand the different iPad App components and learn the basics. Once we all have an understanding of this, we can work on applying it to the project and dividing work up.

Then we took a few moments and added our notes and data from the Bakken and put it in the google folder. This will be useful data later on I’m sure, so make sure you have done this! 
Downloading Xcode can take a while, so we started in class. You can download it from the App Store or get it from a classmate and make sure it is ready to go by Thursday. 

A large portion of class was spent in smaller groups where we researched a couple of different things. One important idea we learned was that we can use git to share the file with our Bakken project very easily. This will function like the blog. We also got into the differences between Swift and Objective-C. In the end, we want to try them out!

Tonight, each of us will make a Hello World button that leads to another screen with Goodbye World. Each person was assigned to do this with Swift or Objective-C (stick to the number you were given). Quinn is also creating a screen cast for buttons so shout out to him!! Check the channels for help with the languages. Really great information in there. Last we took some time to explore in small groups on Xcode. Continue to familiarize yourself here. Make it feel like home. Nil Sine Labore—Do your work.
