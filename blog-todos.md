# Bored?
Why not make the blog better?! Here's a bunch of things that would probably be cool to have:

+ An 'authors' page that displays each author's name, info, and avatar in a grid format
+ A page that lists _all_ posts in reverse chronological order
+ ~~[**Ben and Schmitty**] A "How to post" post (covering GitHub for Mac, the new_post.rb script, etc.)~~
+ A section for tutorial posts we create for each other (a la Schmitty's Markdown Cheat Sheet post)
+ The ability to comment on posts
+ Google Analytics
+ Fix the mobile site (try running the blog on your phone; you'll notice the top button doesn't work, the layout is bad, etc.)
+ [**Brendan**] Alter the new post ruby function so it works when a person has no previous posts.
+ Something else entirely?

Feel free to add to this list! If you are working on one of these, change the above list so that your name is bold and in brackets _before_ the item so that we don't end up duplicating our efforts. For example:

+ [**Sean**] Add section for all posts related to hip hop artist Coolio

Once you've completed the feature and pushed it to GitHub, change the list item to be struck-through:

+ ~~[**Sean**] Add section for all posts related to hip hop artist Coolio~~
