This week, we started work on our main project for the semester. On Friday, we jumped in really quickly to making some (albeit interesting) concepts for our project, but upon going through the ideas, realized that we hadn't really thought about what the *goals* for our project would be. We were somewhat-unknowingly constraining ourselves to a relatively narrow conception of what we thought the project should look like, and got bogged down in trying to make detailed designs when we really needed to take a step back and look at the big picture. However, we also made significant progress this week in figuring out how to use class time productively and setting community expectations, and are getting better at things on that front.
