This week I learned quite a bit about the work necessary in the design process. On the first run through redesigning the schedule, we all just rebuilt the schedule with only ourselves in mind. After we regrouped, we realized that there are many people that have vested interests in the order our classes are in, including teachers, the cafeteria staff, and athletic coaches. I was able to talk to chef Paul Babel and learn about his perspective on the lunch schedule and take his feedback into account when making a new design. We had good ideas regarding the schedule when we presented them to a few guests, but we did not present them in a constructive and informative way. Part of this could be attributed to the little time we had to finalize our ideas, but we should have put presentation as a higher priority in our design process.

I also had the opportunity to help teach the class about posting to the blog (which involves work in GitHub, Terminal, and a text editor) with Schmitty. It was a good experience to co-teach the class for the day, and like our experience with the lunch schedules, our presentation was decent, but we could have prioritized it more in the planning stage.
