This week was focused on developing research, design, presentation and information sharing skills. 

Groups practiced the process of finding problems. The overarching theme was to improve the timetable. Group members talked to others in Blake to find the problems they faced. 

Groups then changed the schedule to solve the problems others had with it. At this step groups came up with a variety of ideas. The lenghts of blocks were changed, the positions of blocks were changed, the class cycle was changed(A and B days vs 5 day school week) and the number of classes was altered. 

Lastly the groups presented the project to an external audience. We discussed the importance of pleasing the audience(next time we need to serve tea), and using the projector vs the whiteboard. The whiteboard allows one to express thoughts more easily while the projector does not. The projector is more for presenting something completely finalized. 

We also looked at using Github as a medium for sharing information and code.
