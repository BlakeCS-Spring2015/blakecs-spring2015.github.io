#General structure

1)listy = [1,2,3, 4]

2) list items are organized by index: 
1 is at index 0, 2 is at index 1

3) to express this in code: 
print listy[3] 
returns 4 

#Adding items to a list

1) the .append method allows things to be added to the list. 

2) listy.append(5) will add 5
so now  print listy 
returns [1,2,3,4,5]

3) to append items from user input
user_input = 1
(to start with make user_input anything but 0)
while user_input != 0:    
(this lines set the condition for when to stop taking items from user. as long as user doesnâ€™t enter 0 program will keep taking more inputs)

 user_input = int(raw_input("enter item: "))  
(the raw_input is a string, int() converts input to integer. this integer is stored in the variable user_input)

listy.append(user_input) 
(adds integer stored in user_input to list)


#Looping over list
1) items in list

print "loop over items"
for i in listy: 
    print i

here the temporary variable i becomes the item in the list


2) print all indexes
  
print "indexes"
for i in range(len(listy)):
  print i
  
The len() command measures the length of the list. 

 ###NOTE ON RANGE()

The range() command uses this measured length(or any other integer put in the brackets)  and populates a temporary list with integer items starting from 0 to the measured length. 

For example range(3) is the list [0,1,2]. 

Therefore for i in range(len(listy)) basically means iterating over the items of the  temporarily created list (by range() command) and using these items as indexes for listy

3) loop over list by index 

print "item by index"
for i in range(len(listy)):
  print listy[i]

while the output will be same as in section 1) of this chapter, this time we used the indexes rather than the items themselves. 

###How do we use while loops for looping over lists.
