So what did we learn last week?
====

This past week I personally learned a ton about approaching a problem that someone else brings to you. In the past I have been the one to come up with the problem and it has really only been my perspective that I have thought about. Seeing a problem like the Blake schedule become so complicated and difficult really opened my eyes to the possibilities in other small problems in our lives. I am really excited to hear what the class's task is this semester and think that this past week has been insanely valuable in preparing us for trying to create something for someone else.

One other thing that we learned is how to present our creations. We want to be sharper and more organized than we were on Thursday when we presented to members of the faculty.
